Co-founder of Atnum  
----------

Atnum is a company that helps the enterprise make secure cloud applications. The core service is video conferencing however Atnum takes a genuinely polyglot approach to creating and maintaining great apps.

If you want to know more about the technical details, then please contact me. If you want to know more about my architectural philosophy - then keep reading.

### Security before all things
Our threat model assumes that the device has been compromised. App development in this situation is problematic, how can the software be trusted?

- Leverage available cloud security infratructure  
    We recomend Oracle cloud for its simple but effective security architecture
- Leverage the existing security community resources
- Slowing down attackers by making static attacks crushingly difficult and isolating systems from one another

These and other techniques form a secure baseline that empowers you and your users.

Building with Atnum, employing security as a guiding force, you gain every opportunity to take a proactive security posture.

### Polyglot application development
Contemporary application development based on  a single language paradigm can become trapped in a bubble of knowledge and idiom. This can work well for certain niche applications, but it also fosters a kind of tribalism.

This can be seen in the  javascript flame wars, hardliners take their stances and refuse to collaborate across communities.

At Atnum we don think so much in terms of languages, rather in terms of engineering concepts,  type systems , dynamics, we favour the basics, maps, lists and working with the compiler to produce optimised code for runtime.  

Simple code is easier to deploy and secure.
